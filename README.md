# Images for talk given at USNA titled The Mathematics of Redistricting: An Introduction
The images were constructed using the code I built in 'MD_pic_builder2.py' and the census block, precincts, and congressional districts provided by either the Census Bureau (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography.html) or MGGG (https://github.com/mggg-states/). 
Images can be found in img, recombination_outputs, and singleflip_outputs.

## Acknoledgements
I would like to thank Daryl DeFord for helping me troubleshoot gerrychain in the construction of these images.
